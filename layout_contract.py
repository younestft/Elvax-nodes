"""Check that ComfyUI's H3 layout still means what this pack thinks it means.

Nothing here modifies ComfyUI. The pack used to wrap
`PackedLayout.__init__` because stock rejected any keyframe anchor other
than the first or last frame. ComfyUI 0.34.0 lifted that restriction, so the
node now just builds keyframe dicts and hands them over. No wrapper, no
ownership of a constructor, and no argument with other packs that patch
the same place.

What is left is a dependency on meaning rather than on structure. Stock
positions a keyframe at

    cond_t = cursor + FRAME_RESCALE * kf["resolved_frame_index"]

where `cursor` is the target timeline's origin, already advanced past any
reference blocks. Two properties of that line matter to this pack and
neither is guaranteed by anything upstream:

  fractional  the audio window has to END at the join, so its index is
              end_frame - rt / FRAME_RESCALE, which is not a whole number
  negative    that index is usually below zero, because the pinned audio
              is a tail that played before this clip starts

Stock's own Add Guide node validates `frame_idx` to a non-negative integer
before it ever reaches the layout, so upstream has no test covering either
property. An int cast or a bounds check added later would not fail loudly
on its own: it would quietly move the pinned audio and put the join in the
wrong place.

So this runs once, before the first render, and proves the arithmetic
still holds. If it does not, the node refuses and says what moved. Same
policy as the patch self-test it replaces, without touching anything.
