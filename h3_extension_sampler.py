"""
Pin previous-clip motion at the head of an H3 clip.

Wire it between a stock H3 conditioning node and the sampler:

    MiniMaxH3ImageToVideo / MiniMaxH3ReferenceToVideo (or the t2v path)
        -> H3 Motion Context
        -> guider / sampler

Two axes to test, both cheap.

encode_mode
  frames  one VAE call per frame, each pinned as its own cond block. The
          model sees N snapshots at N instants.
  video   one VAE call for the whole run. The H3 video VAE has latent_dim
          3, so it reads the batch axis as time and compresses the run
          into fewer latent steps (5 pixel frames -> 2 steps, 22 -> 7).
          Each step becomes one cond block, so the motion between frames
          lives inside the latent instead of being implied across separate
          stills. Far fewer rows and one VAE load.

anchor_mode
  head    pinned frames occupy indices 0..N-1 of the delivered timeline.
          They come back in the output, so trim that many frames off the
          front before concatenating.
  before  pinned frames sit at negative indices, ending at -1, so
          delivered frame 0 continues from them and nothing is wasted.
          Their time coordinates land below text_len, which is the range
          the text rows occupy. Whether that collision matters is exactly
          what this mode is asking.

    A positive overhang means the latent's final step reaches past the

    """Drop the pinned head off a decoded clip, picture and sound together.

    The pinned frames occupy the start of the delivered timeline, so they
    have to come off before concatenating. Trimming only the images would
    leave the audio a full trim_frames longer than the video, and muxing
    those puts the whole soundtrack ahead of the picture by trim_frames/24
    seconds. At 5 frames that is 208ms, silent on ambience but squarely
    offbeat on anything with a pulse.

    So this takes both streams and removes the same span from each: whole
    frames from the images, the matching number of samples from the
    waveform. Wire trim_frames from the motion context node so the count
    follows whatever the encoder actually produced.

    The tail needs the same treatment for a different reason. H3's audio
    latent runs at 40 Hz against 24 fps picture, and FRAME_RESCALE is 5/3,
    so the grid rarely lands on a frame boundary. It rounds to the
    NEAREST step, which means a clip ships either about 8.3 ms more sound
    than picture or about 8.3 ms less, depending on its length:

        frames % 3 == 0   243 wants 405.00 steps, gets 405, exact
        frames % 3 == 1   124 wants 206.67 steps, gets 207, sound is long
        frames % 3 == 2   260 wants 433.33 steps, gets 433, sound is short

    Either way the error compounds. Concatenate two clips and the second
    seam is out by 16.7 ms, three and it is 25 ms, and it grows without
    bound down a chain. It reads as a faint dampening at the first join
    and a short click at later ones. Matching the tail to exactly
    frames/fps stops it accumulating: a long tail is truncated, a short
    one is zero-padded. The padded samples are sound the model never
    generated, so silence is the only honest fill.
